# Data Structures and Algorithms in TypeScript

This is a collection of data structures made from scratch using TypeScript.
The code here can be used as a reference when you want to build out your own data structures, and the documentation is great for learning about each topic.
Don't let the TypeScript scare you!
You could easily follow along in the documentation using Vanilla JavaScript and still make each structure work.

## Getting Started

This setup assumes you already have Node 16 or greater installed.

### Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kensonjohnson/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
```

&nbsp;

### Navigate to Project and Install Packages

```bash
cd data-structures-and-algorithms
npm install
```

## Running a File

Whenever you want to run any file, just use `ts-node` to run the JIT compiler:

```bash
# running file in the current directory
npx ts-node file.ts

# running file using it's path
npx ts-node path/to/the/file.ts
```
